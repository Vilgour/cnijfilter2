Warning (from Vilgour, 26/09/2022) :
This is still work in progress . I'm trying to build it as a guix package but so dirty that I don't make it available for now, it makes no sense.
Anyway, I think it has no chance to work as it is. 
You can install it manually (shortly by following instructions in cnijfilter.spec) but CUPS won't be able to locate the filters.
